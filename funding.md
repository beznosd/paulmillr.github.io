If you'd like to fund my work or donate a few dimes, here are possible options:

* GitHub Sponsors: [github.com/sponsors/paulmillr/](https://github.com/sponsors/paulmillr/)

Other options are available upon request.

### What is the money going to be spent on

* Development of new open-source software
* Maintenance of existing libraries (requires a lot of time on its own)
* Security research
* Hiring third-party security auditors to audit the software
* Education of newcomers

Take a look at [Noble cryptography](/noble/) to understand what i'm working on nowadays.

Thank you!
